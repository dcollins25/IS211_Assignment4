Professor,

I belive the scripts are working as required. 

The only issue is the Insertion Sort method takes way too long while processing lists of 10,000 integers. 
	- For the 10,000 intergers, I reduced the # of lists from 100 down to 3 (which still takes around 45 seconds). 
	- Processing 100 lists of 10,000 integers was taking around 23 minutes!
